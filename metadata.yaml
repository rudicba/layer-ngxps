  Nginx (pronounced "engine x") is a web server. It can act as a reverse proxy
  server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load
  balancer and an HTTP cache.

  Mod_pagespeed is an open-source Apache HTTP Server or Nginx webservers module,
  which automatically applies chosen filters to pages and associated assets,
  such as stylesheets, JavaScript, and HTML files, as well as to images and
  website cache requirements.

  NAXSI is Nginx Anti XSS & SQL injection. In simple words, it's a firewall for
  web applications (WAF) for Nginx, protecting from XSS, SQL injections, CSRF,
  Local & Remote file inclusions. NAXSI is known for its fast working and simple
  configuring. It's a good alternative for mod_security in Apache.
